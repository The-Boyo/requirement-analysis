# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important
- Clarity and Understanding- It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
- Scope Definition- Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
- Basis for Design and Development- Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Gathering 
    It entails gathering information about the requirements of the software. This can be done through interviews, surveys, workshops, observations and document analysis.
- Requirement Elicitation
    It involves brainstorming and holding focused group discussions in order to generate ideas and gather information.   
- Requirement Documentation
    In this step, we create a detailed document that lists all the functional and non-functional requirements as well as user stories to get the ideas from a user perspective.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling 
    Prioritizing requirements based on their importance and impact on the project and creating models (e.g., data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams) to visualize and analyze requirements.
- Requirement Validation
    Reviewing the documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.Acceptance and defining a clear acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet the expected standards while establishing traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed during development and testing.

## Types of Requirements
