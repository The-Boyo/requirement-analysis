# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important
  1. Clarity and Understanding- It helps in understanding what the stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity.
  
  2. Scope Definition- Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps in preventing scope creep.
  
  3. Basis for Design and Development- Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system.
